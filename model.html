        <h1>Model used</h1>
        <p>
            The model used is _very_ simplistic for now. Refering to an
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">infographic</a> of "Our World in Data",
            we are taking the average of the CO2 emissions for beef, lamb (both very CO2 expensive ruminants) and pork and poultry (less CO2 expensive).
        </p>
        <p>
            (60 + 24 + 7 + 6) / 4 => 24.25 kg CO2 per kg meat (crude average ...)
